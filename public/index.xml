      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Ramona, but you&amp;rsquo;ve seen my name on this page enough already.
I&amp;rsquo;m a pastry cook and baker striving to make a career change in to the software industry. A lot of my time is spent working on coding projects, contributing to open source software, and learning programming concepts via python.
Outside of work and career, I love to ride my bike, watch star wars and anime, and spend time with my cat.</description>

      <description>My adventure in software and programming began at a 12-week coding &amp;ldquo;bootcamp&amp;rdquo; immersive course at Carolina Code School. The course was intense and definitely immersive, as I did nothing else but code, sleep, eat, and code.
In that course, we started with some basics in HTML5, CSS and Javascript. Most of our time in that first two weeks was spent with CSS and then we moved on to learn principles of Object-Oriented programming in Javascript.</description>

      <description>As a pastry cook, I was responsible for creating desserts to run as specials. I kept the recipes for those creations in a little pocket-sized notebook. I wanted to create an app that could be used just the same way I used that notebook.</description>
