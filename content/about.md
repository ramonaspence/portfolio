I'm Ramona, but you've seen my name on this page enough already.

I'm a pastry cook and baker striving to make a career change in to the software industry. A lot of my time is spent working on coding projects, contributing to open source software, and learning programming concepts via python.

Outside of work and career, I love to ride my bike, watch star wars and anime, and spend time with my cat. I also really enjoy fitness and listening to music. 

I value authenticity, growth and compassion, and I try to live my life according to those values. I aim to always improve myself and to become more of the person I want to be.
