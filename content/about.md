[This article is a WIP]

I remember being maybe 12 years old when I would spend time on a compaq desktop computer, listening to music and reading about whatever I was hyperfocusing on at the time. I don't remember what initially sparked my interest in programming and software, but I do remember learning about HackThisSite.org and being enthralled with what I could learn. I loved the mix of tinkering and chalelnging it offered and coding has continued to be that for me. 

I've not been coding since I was 12 years old however. In all seriousness, I never thought I could put together a career talking to computers and talking about talking to computers with humans until a student at a coding bootcamp convinced me it was within my reach. At the time, I was motivated by a desire to change careers, especially one that offered a leap into a salary 3 times that of my previous year's earnings. And both of these things lead me to attend a local coding bootcamp, Carolina Code School. 

Coding bootcamps aren't for everyone. It's a lot of information and a lot of work, without much time to process all of it. I graduated from Carolina Code school in early 2020 which proved to be a difficult time to start up a career. So I've continued learning and coding in my spare time while I work full time at a restaurant and bakery doing what I know and still love. 

Now, I contribute to an open source API that aggegrates Tech events local to the Upstate of South Carolina. It's been a fun project for me because it's written in a framework, Flask, that I didn't know anything about when I began working on it. I've learned a lot and not just about Flask but about Git workflow, package management, and reading & writing documentation.
