# About the project  

As a pastry cook, I was responsible for creating desserts to run as specials. I kept the recipes for those creations in a little pocket-sized notebook. I wanted to create an app that could be used just the same way I used that notebook.

Chefs Notebook began as a project for the coding bootcamp I attended. The project continues to be a huge learning experience for me, showing me how little I know and how far I've come. 


# So what can you do with this app?  

A user can create an account, they can create a profile with a display name, an avatar and a bio, and they can create and save recipes. The user can interact with other users by commenting on others' recipes or their own, and by following others users to keep up with what recipes they're working on. 

Once a user has followed some people, their recipes will be listed on that user's dashboard or they can check out all of the recipes in the database on the Explore page, where you can filter through recipes. 

A really cool piece of this app is the way it uses the Clarifai API. Clarifai is a an AI-powered API that describes an image with keywords. When a user creates a recipe with an image, that image gets fed to Clarifai which then returns what it "sees" inside the image. 

If you uploaded a picture of a pizza, the keywords it returns might be Pizza, Cheese, Pepperoni, tomato sauce, and etc. Those keywords are saved with the recipe as tags, which are then used for the search feature on the Explore tab. An automatic tagging system. Pretty cool? Pretty cool.
