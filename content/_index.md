I graduated a 12-week [coding bootcamp](https://ramonaspence.github.io/website-portfolio-hugo/ccs/) in 2020. There I completed daily and weekly assignments, all of which required writing and implementing functional code. 

Since then, much of my experience has been with Rest APIs. I've built an API for my personal project, [Chef's Notebook](https://ramonaspence.github.io/website-portfolio-hugo/projects/chefs-notebook/), in Django Rest Framework as well as in assignments at the coding bootcamp. I also have experience with applications that consume third-party APIs, such as Meetup's and Eventbrite's API.

Through open source contributions, I've gained familiarity with Git workflow and operations, such as managing branches, syncing with a remote repository, performing manual rebases. It's also given me the opportunity to use Github's issue tracker in projects that aren't my own, as well as creating pull requests.

I'm now looking for my first full-time role as a software developer.
