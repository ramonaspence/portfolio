I don&rsquo;t remember what initially sparked my interest in programming and software, but I do remember learning about HackThisSite.org and being enthralled with what I could learn. I loved the mix of tinkering and chalelnging it offered and coding has continued to be that for me.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve not been coding since I was 12 years old however. In all seriousness, I never thought I could put together a career talking to computers and talking about talking to computers with humans until a student at a coding bootcamp convinced me it was within my reach. At the time, I was motivated by a desire to change careers, especially one that offered a leap into a salary 3 times that of my previous year&rsquo;s earnings. And both of these things lead me to attend a local coding bootcamp, Carolina Code School.</p><p>Coding bootcamps aren&rsquo;t for everyone. It&rsquo;s a lot of information and a lot of work, without much time to process all of it. I graduated from Carolina Code school in early 2020 which proved to be a difficult time to start up a career. So I&rsquo;ve continued learning and coding in my spare time while I work full time at a restaurant and bakery doing what I know and still love.</p><p>Now, I contribute to an open source API that aggegrates Tech events local to the Upstate of South Carolina. It&rsquo;s been a fun project for me because it&rsquo;s written in a framework, Flask, that I didn&rsquo;t know anything about when I began working on it. I&rsquo;ve learned a lot and not just about Flask but about Git workflow, package management, and reading & writing documentation.</p></div><footer class=content__footer></footer></section><section class=page__aside><div class=aside__about><div class=aside__about><img class=about__logo src=https://ramonaspence.github.io/website-portfolio-hugo/images/rice.svg alt=Logo><h1 class=about__title>ramona e.j. spence</h1><p class=about__description>Hi!
