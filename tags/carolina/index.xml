The course was intense and definitely immersive, as I did nothing else but code, sleep, eat, and code.
In that course, we started with some basics in HTML5, CSS and Javascript. Most of our time in that first two weeks was spent with CSS and then we moved on to learn principles of Object-Oriented programming in Javascript.</description></item></channel></rss>
