The course was intense and definitely immersive, as I did nothing else but code, sleep, eat, and code.</p><p>In that course, we started with some basics in HTML5, CSS and Javascript. Most of our time in that first two weeks was spent with CSS and then we moved on to learn principles of Object-Oriented programming in Javascript.</p><p>Assignments in this course were unlike any I&rsquo;ve had. After a lecture in the morning, it was up to us as individual students to apply those concepts, read related documentation, and figure out how to complete the assignment with the most widely used tool in all of software: Google.</p><p>After we learned some programming basics with Javascript, we jumped into ReactJS which naturally included a lot of learning about client-side concepts and tools. This ranged from simple debugging with a <code>console.log()</code> here and there to learning what the DOM is.</p><p>Finally we got to my favorite part: Python and Django. First we dove back into object-oriented programming and learned the absolute basics of python.</p><p>Not long after that we were implementing Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality in Django applications. It felt like Django had so much in store for me and I couldn&rsquo;t wait to dig it up. I&rsquo;ve continued to learn about Django and how to build with it for the last two years.</p><p>The course wrapped up with a final, full-stack project in React, Django, PostgresQL and deployed on Heroku. This is when I began working on my project, the <a href=https://ramonaspence.github.io/website-portfolio-hugo/projects/chefs-notebook/>Chef&rsquo;s Notebook</a>. Our final projects had to be our own ideas, and while there were requirements to meet, these projects were unlike any of our previous assignments.</p><p>For me, this was just the beginning. I still might say that I&rsquo;m just beginning, even though I&rsquo;ve come so far.</p></div><footer class=content__footer></footer></section><section class=page__aside><div class=aside__about><div class=aside__about><img class=about__logo src=https://ramonaspence.github.io/website-portfolio-hugo/images/rice.svg alt=Logo><h1 class=about__title>ramona e.j. spence</h1><p class=about__description>Hi!
