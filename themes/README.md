This theme is created by Joe Roe. 
See the main repository at github.com/joeroe/risotto

I have added this theme by forking the original repository to my github. Then I added the forked repository to the [website's repository](github.com/ramonaspence/website-portfolio-hugo) as a submodule.  

I have added the theme this way and not directly from the forked repository so that I can make small modifications to my website via the theme. An example modification is in the layout. [Here](https://risotto.joeroe.io/) you can see the theme as two pages, `about` and `posts` but you can see that [on my website](https://ramonaspence.github.io/website-portfolio-hugo/projects/), I have changed `posts` to `projects`.
