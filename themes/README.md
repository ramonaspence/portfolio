This theme is created by Joe Roe. 
See the [main repository](https://github.com/joeroe/risotto)

I have added this theme by forking the original repository to my github. Then I added the forked repository to the [website's repository](https://github.com/ramonaspence/website-portfolio-hugo) as a submodule.  

I have added the theme this way and not directly from the forked repository so that I can make small modifications to the theme for my website specifically. A small example is the difference in color schemes, between my website and the [example website](https://risotto.joeroe.io/) for the theme.
